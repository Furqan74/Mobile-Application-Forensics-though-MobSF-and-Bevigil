# Mobile-Application-Forensics-Though-MobSF-and-Bevigil

🚨Beware of Untrusted APKs! 🚨
I recently completed an eye opening project on malware-injected applications. By creating a controlled malware sample, injecting it into an app, and performing indepth forensic analysis, I learned some crucial lessons:
🔍 Understanding Malware Behavior: Through tools like BeVigil, and MobSF, we uncovered how malware exploits app vulnerabilities.
🛡️ Key Takeaway: Never install applications from untrusted sources. Unofficial APK files can contain malicious code that steals your data and compromises your device's security.
💡 Always download apps from trusted and verified sources to protect your personal information. This project highlighted the importance of rigorous security measures in app development.
